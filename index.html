            <h2>Our History</h2>
            <p>The Stark's of Winterfell can trace their lineage back to the first men.
                Our proud house has lived in this icy climate for hundreds of years.
                It is more than our furs and hot springs that keep us warm during
                the long winters, it is the need of our southern customers for our
                prized ice that keeps our northern hearts ablaze!
            </p>
            <p>
                What would an Dornish Venom-tini be without it's signature
                red ice cubes? SWILL THATS WHAT! Do you think that the high lords
                and ladies of the Red Keep would enjoy their wines half so much
                as they do when they are chilled by the ice of Winterfell? NAY!
            </p>
            <p>
                Our house has provided solid icy-ice to those of a southern persuasion
                for hundreds of years and we will continue to do so for hundreds more!
            </p>

            <h2>How our Ice is Made</h2>
            <img src="ice.jpeg" alt="Three melty ice cubes">
            <p>For the commoners out there: ice is made from frozen water. Therefore
                in order to make the best ice we must start with the best water.
            </p>
            <p>It may be known to some of you that parts of the Castle Winterfell are heated by water
                from a pristine hot spring. When this water has cooled down during its journey through
                the castle walls it is filtered through screens of fine linen and then stored inside
                insulated barrels.
            </p>
            <p>
                Next the water is stored outside to freeze. The icy winds of the north see to this in a hurry.
                Within a day's time the water is frozen solid. Within three days the temperature is so cold
                that it will take a month sitting in the blinding sun for it to warm up enough to begin to melt!
            </p>
            <p>
                After the three day freezing period the insulated barrels are loaded into an insulated carriage
                where they will begin their journey southward. We focus on fulfilling orders but always have
                extra barrels in case we come upon a Southern Inn or Castle with a need for Stark's Ice!
